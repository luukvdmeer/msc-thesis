abstract = {Abstract Forecast intervals typically depend upon an assumption of normal forecast errors due to lack of information concerning the distribution of the forecast. This article applies the bootstrap to the problem of estimating forecast intervals for an AR(p) model. Box-Jenkins intervals are compared to intervals produced from a naive bootstrap and a bias-correction bootstrap. Substantial differences between the three methods are found. Bootstrapping an AR(p) model requires use of the backward residuals which typically are not i.i.d. and hence inappropriate for bootstrap resampling. A recently developed method of obtaining i.i.d. backward residuals is employed and was found to affect the bootstrap prediction intervals.},

abstract = {Classical methods based on Gaussian likelihood or least-squares cannot identify non-invertible moving average processes, while recent non-Gaussian results are based on full likelihood consideration. Since the error distribution is rarely known a quasilikelihood approach is desirable, but its consistency properties are yet unknown. In this paper we study the quasi-likelihood associated with the Laplacian model, a convenient non-Gaussian model that yields a modified L1 procedure. We show that consistency holds for all standard heavy tailed errors, but not for light tailed errors, showing that a quasi-likelihood procedure cannot be applied blindly to estimate non-invertible models. This is an interesting contrast to the standard results of the quasi-likelihood in regression models, where consistency usually holds much more generally. Similar results hold for estimation of non-causal non-invertible ARMA processes. Various simulation studies are presented to validate the theory and to show the effect of the error distribution, and an analysis of the US unemployment series is given as an illustration.},

abstract = {China leads the world in both public bikeshare and private electric bike (e-bike) growth. Current trajectories indicate the viability of deploying large-scale shared e-bike (e-bikeshare) systems in China. We employ a stated preference survey and multinomial logit to model the factors influencing the choice to switch from an existing transportation mode to bikeshare or e-bikeshare in Beijing. Demand is influenced by distinct sets of factors: the bikeshare choice is most sensitive to measures of effort and comfort while the e-bikeshare choice is more sensitive to user heterogeneities. Bikeshare demand is strongly negatively impacted by trip distance, temperature, precipitation, and poor air quality. User demographics however do not factor strongly on the bikeshare choice, indicating the mode will draw users from across the social spectrum. The e-bikeshare choice is much more tolerant of trip distance, high temperatures and poor air quality, though precipitation is also a highly negative factor. User demographics do play a significant role in e-bikeshare demand. Analysis of impact to the existing transportation system finds that both bikeshare and e-bikeshare will tend to draw users away from the “unsheltered modes”, walk, bike, and e-bike. Although it is unclear if shared bikes are an attractive “first-and-last-mile solution”, it is clear that e-bikeshare is attractive as a bus replacement.},

This success has increased the interest in exploring the factors affecting bicycle-sharing flows and usage. Using data compiled as minute-by-minute readings of bicycle availability at all the stations of the BIXI system between April and August 2012, this study contributes to the literature on bicycle-sharing. We examine the influence of meteorological data, temporal characteristics, bicycle infrastructure, land use and built environment attributes on arrival and departure flows at the station level using a multilevel approach to statistical modeling, which could easily be applied to other regions. The findings allow us to identify factors contributing to increased usage of bicycle-sharing in Montreal and to provide recommendations pertaining to station size and location decisions. The developed methodology and findings can be of benefit to city planners and engineers who are designing or modifying bicycle-sharing systems with the goal of maximizing usage and availability.},

abstract = {Public Bicycle Sharing Programs (PBSPs) have become a prominent feature across city spaces worldwide. In less than a decade, PBSPs have grown from a small number of European cities to include five continents and in excess of 200 schemes. Despite the rapid rise of this new transport opportunity, there has been limited research on the underlying dynamics of these schemes, arguably reflecting a lack of detailed data available to researchers. The current paper redresses the observed deficit using trip level data from Brisbane's ‘CityCycle', the largest PBSP in Australia. These data provide an opportunity to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of a large PBSP system, specifically the effects of weather and calendar events on the geographic and temporal patterning of public bicycle use. Employing novel spatial analytical techniques we explore the impact of site specific weather conditions and calendar events on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the case study PBSP. We conclude by highlighting how the results from such analyses may form part of an evidence base for policy makers, providing insights into ‘best practice' and potentially informing future PBSP expansions to further enhance uptake of this non-motorised urban transport mode.},

The first two methods, namely the Space-Time ARIMA (STARIMA) and the Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) model with spatial priors apply when interest lies on the spatio-temporal evolution of a single variable. The former is better suited for applications of large spatial and temporal dimension whereas the latter can be realistically performed when the number of locations of the study is rather small. Next, we consider models that aim to describe relationships between variables with a spatio-temporal reference and discuss the general class of dynamic space-time models in the framework presented by Elhorst (2001). Each model class is introduced through a motivating application.},

abstract = {The most rapidly growing carsharing system in North America and Europe is the free-floating one (FFCS). In a FFCS system customers can book and return vehicles of the fleet in every place of a defined operating area. While first studies tried to characterize the user of such a system and explain the booking behavior this work focuses on the short times prediction of FFCS bookings. Booking data of the FFCS operator DriveNow in Berlin are the basis for the forecast. They enable modeling time series for vehicle bookings by hour. The forecast provides predictions for every hour of a future week. To include spatial differences of FFCS bookings forecasts are calculated for every zip code area. Two methods of time series analysis are used to compare their performance for the present data: A seasonal ARIMA model and exponential smoothing with Holt-Winters-Filter. These two models are realized each with four settings. They are based upon data of a whole year, a half-year, a quarter or just a month and compared regarding their precision and practicability. Preliminary analyses such as the spectral analysis show that FFCS booking frequencies have weekly recurring trends. Additionally, it is visible that in areas with a high booking density this level lasts for the whole time. By this, spectral analysis can be applied as a spatial clustering method. The comparison of the two tools of time series analysis yields to the Holt-Winters Filtering (HWF) as the favorite method. Finding the optimal parameters for the ARIMA models is computationally intensive and results in just equally good or even worse forecasts than with exponential smoothing. The best prediction is performed with Holt-Filters-Filtering using three months of booking data. The forecast predicts bookings with an average error of only 0.84 vehicles per hour. The largest average absolute error of all compared forecast models is around 20{\%} higher but makes the model still useful in practice though.},

abstract = {The bike-sharing service has brought many conveniences to citizens and served as an effective supplement to the mass transit system. For docked bike-sharing service, each docking station has the designated location to store bikes and the station could be empty or saturated in different times. Bike-sharing operators generally redistribute bikes between stations by driving trucks according to their experiences which might lead unnecessary human resources It is ineffective for the operators and inconvenient for users to access this service. Therefore, predicting an accurate number of available bikes in the stations is important for both the operators and users. This paper mainly focuses on the short-term forecasting for docking station usage in a case of Suzhou, China. Two latest and highly efficient models here, LSTM and GRU, are adopted to predict the short-term available number of bikes in docking stations with one-month historical data. Random Forest is used to compare as a benchmark. The results show that both RNNs (LSTM and GRU) and Random Forest able to achieve good performance with acceptable error and comparative accuracies. Random forest is more advantageous in terms of training time while LSTM with complex structures can predict better for the long term. The maximum difference between the real data and the predicted value is only 1 or 2 bikes, which supports the developed models are practically ready to use.},

Furthermore, four types of GCNN models are proposed whose adjacency matrices are based on various bike-sharing system data, including Spatial Distance matrix (SD), Demand matrix (DE), Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD), and Demand Correlation matrix (DC). These six types of GCNN models and seven other benchmark models are built and compared on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes 272 stations and over 28 million transactions from 2013 to 2016. Results show that the GCNNrec-DDGF performs the best in terms of the Root Mean Square Error, the Mean Absolute Error and the coefficient of determination (R2), followed by the GCNNreg-DDGF. They outperform the other models. Through a more detailed graph network analysis based on the learned DDGF, insights are obtained on the “black box” of the GCNN-DDGF model. It is found to capture some information similar to details embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices. More importantly, it also uncovers hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that are not revealed by any of those matrices.},

abstract = {Over the last three years, the dockless bike sharing scheme has become prevalent in the context of the boom in the sharing economy, the wide use of mobile online payment, the increasing environmental awareness and the inherent market demand. This research takes Beijing as a case study, investigates the users' characteristics, their behaviour change, and perceptions of dockless bike sharing scheme by the quantitative survey, and then analyzes the reasons behind it and how it has changed the residents' life in Beijing. This new kind of dockless shared bikes, with great advantages of accessibility, flexibility, efficiency and affordability, helps to solve the ‘last mile' problem, reduce the travel time, and seems to be very environmentally-friendly and sustainable. However, with the help of interview and document analysis, this research finds that the shared bikes are not the effective alternative for the frequent car-users. Nevertheless, it also has numerous negative consequences such as ‘zombie' bikes blocking the sidewalks and vandalism to the bikes. The public is also worried about their quality and safety, especially the issues of ‘right of way'. How to coordinate and solve these problems is not only related to the future direction of the dockless bike sharing scheme but also to the vital interests of the general public. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that governments, enterprises, and the public participate in multi-party cooperation and build synergic governance networks to carry forward the advantages and avoid the negative effects of the new bike sharing system.},

abstract = {This study quantifies the motivators and barriers to bikeshare program usage in Australia. An online survey was administered to a sample of annual members of Australia's two bikeshare programs based in Brisbane and Melbourne, to assess motivations for joining the schemes. Non-members of the programs were also sampled in order to identify current barriers to joining bikeshare. Spatial analysis from Brisbane revealed residential and work locations of non-members were more geographically dispersed than for bikeshare members. An analysis of bikeshare usage in Melbourne showed a strong relationship between docking stations in areas with relatively less accessible public transit opportunities. The most influential barriers to bikeshare use related to motorized travel being too convenient and docking stations not being sufficiently close to home, work and other frequented destinations. The findings suggest that bikeshare programs may attract increased membership by ensuring travel times are competitive with motorized travel, for example through efficient bicycle routing and priority progression and, by expanding docking station locations, and by increasing the level of convenience associated with scheme use. Convenience considerations may include strategic location of docking stations, ease of signing up and integration with public transport.},

abstract = {As a healthy and environment-friendly trip mode, public bicycle-sharing systems, which have so far been built in hundreds of cities around the world, have been developing rapidly recently. The public bicycle-sharing systems, which are usually spatially embedded where original urban bus transport networks are located, comprise the new urban public transport system together with the bus transport networks. Therefore, studying the impact of the public bicycle-sharing systems on the original urban public transport networks is an important research subject. In this study, using the real spatial location data of the public bicycle-sharing systems of Hangzhou and Ningbo in China, we propose a multi-layer coupling spatial network model that considers the geographical information on bus stations, bus routes, and public bicycle stations by studying the urban public transport networks. The spatial network model consists of bus subnets, short-distance bicycle subnets, and short-distance walk subnets which are interdependent rather than independent. We apply the model to study the influence of bicycling between the short-distance bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between the short-distance bus station pairs (SDW) on the performance of the urban public transport networks. Results show that SDB and SDW can significantly reduce the average transfer times, the average path length of passengers' trips and the Gini coefficient of an urban public transport network. Therefore, the public bicycle-sharing systems can decrease the average trip time of passengers and increase the efficiency of an urban public transport network, as well as effectively improve the uneven level of traffic flow spatial distribution of an urban public transport network and will be helpful to smoothening the traffic flow and alleviating traffic congestion.},

abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems are increasingly popular around the world and have the potential to increase the visibility of people cycling in everyday clothing. This may in turn help normalise the image of cycling, and reduce perceptions that cycling is ‘risky' or ‘only for sporty people'. This paper sought to compare the use of specialist cycling clothing between users of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) and cyclists using personal bicycles. To do this, we observed 3594 people on bicycles at 35 randomly-selected locations across central and inner London. The 592 LBSS users were much less likely to wear helmets (16{\%} vs. 64{\%} among personal-bicycle cyclists), high-visibility clothes (11{\%} vs. 35{\%}) and sports clothes (2{\%} vs. 25{\%}). In total, 79{\%} of LBSS users wore none of these types of specialist cycling clothing, as compared to only 30{\%} of personal-bicycle cyclists. This was true of male and female LBSS cyclists alike (all p{\textgreater}0.25 for interaction). We conclude that bicycle sharing systems may not only encourage cycling directly, by providing bicycles to rent, but also indirectly, by increasing the number and diversity of cycling ‘role models' visible.},

Then, we suggest a methodology able to generate spatio-temporal clusters of the usage patterns of the available bikes in every zone of the city, forecast the bicycles use trend (by means of Non-linear Autoregressive Neural Networks) for each cluster, and consequently enhance and simplify the relocation process in the network.},

abstract = {City-wide urban infrastructures are increasingly reliant on network technology to improve and expand their services. As a side effect of this digitalization, large amounts of data can be sensed and analyzed to uncover patterns of human behavior. In this paper, we focus on the digital footprints from one type of emerging urban infrastructure: shared bicycling systems. We provide a spatiotemporal analysis of 13 weeks of bicycle station usage from Barcelona's shared bicycling system, called Bicing. We apply clustering techniques to identify shared behaviors across stations and show how these behaviors relate to location, neighborhood, and time of day. We then compare experimental results from four predictive models of near-term station usage. Finally, we analyze the impact of factors such as time of day and station activity in the prediction capabilities of the algorithms},

Based on data sampled from the operator's website, it is possible to detect temporal and geographic mobility patterns within the city. These patterns are applied to predict the number of available bikes for any station some minutes/hours ahead. The predictions could be used to improve the bicycle program and the information given to the users via the Bicing website. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{yang2016,
abstract = {As an innovative mobility strategy, public bike-sharing has grown dramatically worldwide. Though providing convenient, low-cost and environmental-friendly transportation, the unique features of bike-sharing systems give rise to problems to both users and operators. The primary issue among these problems is the uneven distribution of bicycles caused by the ever-changing usage and (available) supply. This bicycle imbalance issue necessitates efficient bike re-balancing strategies, which depends highly on bicycle mobility modeling and prediction. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a spatio-temporal bicycle mobility model based on historical bike-sharing data, and devise a traffic prediction mechanism on a per-station basis with sub-hour granularity. We extensively evaluated the performance of our design through a one-year dataset from the world's largest public bike-sharing system (BSS) with more than 2800 stations and over 103 million check in/out records. Evaluation results show an 85 percentile relative error of 0.6 for both check in and check out prediction. We believe this new mobility modeling and prediction approach can advance the bike re-balancing algorithm design and pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of bike-sharing systems across the globe.},
